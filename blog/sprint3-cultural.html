    <h2 class="sprint2-cultural-h2">Emotional Intelligence</h2>
    <h3 class="sprint3-cultural-h3">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">From my experience in life, and newly enriched by the research I've done this week,
      I've come to see emotional intelligence as a lifelong cultivation of self-awareness and
      awareness of others.  It's the ability to identify and relate to emotions and how you can apply this 
      knowledge to bettering the situation.  
      Emotional intelligence can help you be content in your personal life, and excel in your professional career, as well as 
      help in many other aspects of your life, which is why it's so important to invest time into improving it.    

      I found a definition of emotional intelligence that I really like;<br>
      <br>
      <i>"Emotional Quotient is the set of skills that enable us to make our way in a complex world â€” the personal, social and survival 
      aspects of overall intelligence, the elusive common sense and sensitivity that are essential to effective daily functioning. 
      It has to do with the ability to read the political and social environment, and landscape them; to intuitively grasp what others 
      want and need, what strengths and weaknesses are; to remain unruffled by stress; and to be engaging. The kind of person others 
      want to be around and will follow."  -Steven J. Stein, Ph.D. and Howard E. Book, M.D.</i></p>

      <h3 class="sprint3-cultural-h3">How Does it Differ from IQ?</h3>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">IQ, which stands for Intelligence Quotient, is a measure of traditional intelligence, having a high IQ is like being fluent in the language of information and 
        analytical thinking, whereas emotional intelligence is the language of understanding people and the world around us.  While IQ is undeniably an excellent and
        important skill to have, emotional intelligence is arguably more beneficial in the success of relationships, your job, surviving in the 
        complex world that we live in and just being happy in general.   
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="sprint3-cultural-h3">Why is it Important?</h3>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">There are many different factors of emotional intelligence, a few of which I summarised from <a href="http://transforming.com/2017/08/09/5-critical-factors-emotional-intelligence/" target="blank">this blog</a>, 
        such as;</p>
        <ul class="sprint3-cultural-para">
          <li>Self-awareness - mood, tone and language that determines your demeanour</li>
          <li>Self-regulation - think before you speak and know your actions are affecting others</li>
          <li>Motivation - a passion for working towards your goals and value by improving your skills over time</li>
          <li>Empathy for others - identifying and acting accordingly to someone elses emotional state</li>
          <li>Social skills - networking, stepping out of your comfort zone</li>
        </ul>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">that can all contribute to a much happier and successful life.  Of course it all comes down to what you value in life and what kind
      of lifestyle you want to live; one persons definition of a happy successful life is not necessarily what the next person strives for, 
      but it is generally discussed that emotional intelligence is a very beneficial awareness to have.  

      More relevant to those of us that are studying and planning for a career in development and programming, emotional intelligence is going to
      help us get a job.  Leadership skills, excellent listening and communication, ability to read others in the team and being aware of oneself are all 
      skills that are going to help us secure a job and excel in that position.  </p>

      <h2 class="sprint3-cultural-h2">Attention Training</h2>
        
      <h3 class="sprint3-cultural-h3">What was it like for you to practice mindfulness?</h3>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">Honestly, I didn't enjoy the HeadSpace app after my first experience with it just now.  I am completely new to any 
        form of meditation, so it was a pretty alien experience, but the information behind it makes sense, and I trust the curriculum is 
        the most beneficial it can be for us, so I'll keep trying.  </p>
      <h3 class="sprint3-cultural-h3">Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?</h3>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">I've seen workshops available quite regularly for practicing mindfulness at my work.  I've never participated,
        because I never knew what it meant or bothered to find out, but now I will try and get a slot in the next one.</p>
      <h3 class="sprint3-cultural-h3">Are you able to identify any bias you have for or against mindfulness?</h3>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">As of now, I haven't heard any solid opinions on the practice from anyone that I'd trust to base my opinion off.  My little
        sister has recommended the app before, but I've personally never been that interested.  </p>
      <h3 class="sprint3-cultural-h3">What did you notice as you were meditating?</h3> 
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">That suddenly I was hyperaware of my own body and it made me quite uncomfortable.  I know this sounds extreme, but I am quite
        squeamish and do not like to be at all aware of how my body is functioning in any great detail.  I'd usually distract myself from these
        thoughts as they make me feel light-headed, (I wish I wasn't like this).  I lasted 3 minutes before I turned it off, mostly because of
        the previous reason, but also because I didn't like his voice.  </p>
      <h3 class="sprint3-cultural-h3">How did you find the overall experience?</h3>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">Of course I won't base my whole opinion of mindfulness of that one experience.  The concept seems promising, I just might have to explore 
        other ways to practice it, or hopefully become less uncomfortable with time as I adjust to that level of physical awareness.  </p>
      <h3 class="sprint3-cultural-h3">What's your daily habit commitment?</h3>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">I have tried to commit to a morning routine of meditating after I wake up and before I start my day, because ideally it will be
        a good way to clear my mind of runaway thoughts before I start my day.  </p>
      
      <h2 class="sprint3-cultural-h2">Listening and Looping</h2>
      <h3 class="sprint3-cultural-h3">What was it like to be fully listened to?</h3>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">I completed the looping task with Jennifer using zoom, it was nice to chat to someone from our course and she was lovely.  I'm not
        someone that likes to be the one talking, I prefer listening, so unobstructed talking for 2 minutes was actually quite difficult and I 
        was babbling a bit haha.  But when it comes to a situation where you want to be heard, having someone listen without talking would be
        encouraging.  
      </p>
      <h3 class="sprint3-cultural-h3">What was it like to fully listen?</h3>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">I enjoyed listening, I feel like I want to comfort whoever is speaking so they feel confident being listened to.  I've been trying to practice
        listening to people without my own input since I read this over this task, and I can see that it makes a difference.
