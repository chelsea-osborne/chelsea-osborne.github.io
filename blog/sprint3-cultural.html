    <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
    <p>From my experience in life, and newly enriched by the research I've done this week,
      I've come to see emotional intelligence as a lifelong cultivation of self-awareness and
      awareness of others, and how you can act on this knowledge.  Emotional intelligence can help 
      you be content in your personal life, and excel in your professional career, as well as 
      many other aspects, which is why it's so important to invest time into improvement.  

      This can be achieved through different means, but the methods that we've been practicing this 
      week include mindfulness meditation, conscious listening and journalling.
