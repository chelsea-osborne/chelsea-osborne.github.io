  <h2 class="sprint2-cultural-h2">What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>
  <p class="sprint2-cultural-para">Classes and ids are naming conventions that allow you to manipulate each element that is associated 
      with a specific class or id.  A class can be applied to multiple elements, whereas an id should only be applied to one specific element.  
      In the css file, you can reference the class that you applied to multiple elements and then manipulate all of the content at once.  For an id, you 
      can reference the id and create a unique set of manipulations for that one specific element.  
      In the hierarchy of how the browser reads the imformation, an id tag will override a class tag.
