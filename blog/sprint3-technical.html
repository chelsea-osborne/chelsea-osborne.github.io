      <h2 class="sprint3-cultural-h2">The Difference Between HTML and CSS</h2>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">HTML is the basis and structure of a webpage,
          it includes the content and information to be displayed.  CSS determines how
          that information is to be displayed.  They work togehter to display what we see when we 
          go onto a webpage.  It goes together like form and function.  If you were designing a shoe,
          the HTML would say, make it a covered shoe with a sole and a heel.  The CSS would determine 
          the design of the shoe, so the covered part of the shoe is black suede, the sole is 
          wooden, and the heel is platform.  </p>
      <h2 class="sprint3-cultural-h2">Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">Control Flow is the order in which the code is read in your script, generally from top to 
        bottom, unless you tell it to do otherwise.  This may be because of an 'if-then' statement, in which the code will only be executed 
        if a particular statement is true.  If it equates to false, than an 'if-then-else' statement will tell anothe set of code to be run 
        instead.  There is multiple different statemnts that may manipulate the control flow.  <br><br>
        A real life example of this would be the process of sharpening a pack of pencil, the command can be to sharpen the pencil, if the following 
        statement is true; 'the pencil is blunt'.  If the pencil is blunt then the steps to sharpen it will be executed, however if the statement is 
        false, then the computer knows to execute a different set of code, which in this exampe would be, move onto checking the next pencil.  <br>
        <br>
        Looping is when a set of instructions are repeated until a condition changes from true to false, which then allows the 
        computer move onto the next lines of code.  For example, while sharpening the pencil, the instruction might be one revolution
        of the pencil in the sharpener, check if it is still blunt, if true it will repeat the step until eventually the pencil is no longer 
        blunt, so the statement will read as false, and it will move onto the next instruction.  </p>
      <h2 class="sprint3-cultural-h2">The DOM</h2>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para"> The DOM stands for Document Object Model, and it is implemented by browsers to 
        make a model of the HTML page, in the form of a DOM tree, which is a hierarchical visual representation of all of the objects 
        in the document.  Each object is represented by one of four nodes; a document node, element node, attribute node or text 
        node.  We are able to access the DOM tree using the browsers DevTools, and use Javascript to locate element nodes, and manipulate these 
        however you want to.  </p>
      <h2 class="sprint3-cultural-h2">Acessing Data from Arrays and Objects</h2>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">Arrays are like a list of information, where you can isolate and manipulate any item on
          the list, by telling the computer its location in the list.  The computer doesn't know
          what these items are, it just sees it as ordered text.  <br><br>
          Objects are like a folder that is full of imformation about that specific object, there are characteristics
          and each characteristic has a value.  For example you may have a object called myDog, that's full of imformation 
          about my dog.  It will have characteristics such as name, breed, age and so on.  So I could ask my computer, 'Hey, what's the 
        name of myDog?' And it will give me the value of it's name, which is John.</p>
      <h2 class="sprint3-cultural-h2">Functions</h2>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">Functions are a series of statements, that perform a specific
          task when they are run.  They are useful for when you want to use this code multiple times,
          because you can just command the function name, instead of rewriting all of the code each time.  </p>
