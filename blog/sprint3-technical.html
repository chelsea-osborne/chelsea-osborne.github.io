      <h2 class="sprint3-cultural-h2">The Difference Between HTML and CSS</h2>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">HTML is the basis and structure of a webpage,
          it includes the content and information to be displayed.  CSS determines how
          that information is to be displayed.  They work togehter to display what we see when we 
          go onto a webpage.  It goes together like form and function.  If you were designing a shoe,
          the HTML would say, make it a covered shoe with a sole and a heel.  The CSS would determine 
          the design of the shoe, so the covered part of the shoe is black suede, the sole is 
          wooden, and the heel is platform.  </p>
      <h2 class="sprint3-cultural-h2">Flow and Loops</h2>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, 
          for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</p>
      <h2 class="sprint3-cultural-h2">The DOM</h2>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</p>
      <h2 class="sprint3-cultural-h2">Acessing Data from Arrays and Objects</h2>
      <p>Arrays are like a list of information, where you can isolate and manipulate any item on
          the list, by telling the computer its location in the list.  The computer doesn't know
          what these items are, it just sees it as ordered text.  <br><br>
          Objects are like a folder that is full of imformation about that specific object, there are characteristics
          and each characteristic has a value.  For example you may have a object called myDog, that's full of imformation 
          about my dog.  It will have characteristics such as name, breed, age and so on.  So I could ask my computer, 'Hey, what's the 
        name of myDog?' And it will give me the value of it's name, which is John.</p>
      <h2 class="sprint3-cultural-h2">Functions</h2>
      <p class="sprint3-cultural-para">Functions are a series of statements, that perform a specific
          task when they are run.  They are useful for when you want to use this code multiple times,
          because you can just command the function name, instead of rewriting all of the code each time.  </p>
