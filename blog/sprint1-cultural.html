    <h3 class="sprint2-cultural-h3">Ethical Decision Making</h3>
    <p class="sprint2-cultural-para">A year ago, my mum sold her house and the new location that she was renting allowed only two pets.  At the time they, (my mum and two youngest siblings), couldn't find a 
      place for a very long time so this was the last resort.  Out of five kids, four of us had a kitten each when we were young, so there is four family cats and only two allowed at the new rental.  In order 
      to not have to give up a family pet to the spca, my older sister and I agreed to adopt a cat each until they could find somewhere to have them all.  
      Since I live in a flat with five other girls, this took some convincing, and the cat I took, Bluebelle, was one of the troublesome ones, to take some pressure off my mum.  She cost a lot in vet bills,
      and annoyed the hell out of me, but I did it so my little sister didn't have to give up her beloved pet.  </p>
    <h3 class="sprint2-cultural-h3">Culture</h3>
    <p class="sprint2-cultural-para">I grew up in New Zealand, which is a friendly, safe environment, with plenty of opportunity.  Growing up, my childhood wasn't storybook, my role model was definitely my mum,
      she showed my siblings and I that there is no limit to what you can achieve if you put in the effort.  Working hard and solving problems will help you get places,
      opposed to giving up or feeling sorry for yourself.  She taught us to value family above everything, to look out for each other, and we do, my three sisters and brother all help lift each other up in all situations.  
    </p>
    <h3 class="sprint2-cultural-h3">Strengths and Limitations</h3>
    <p class="sprint2-cultural-para">The value of working within my family easily translates to working well in a team in a professional environment.  Learning to read people,
      letting everyone have a say and speaking up for those whose ideas are ignored. TThere is a solution to any problem, you just have to use some ingenuity to figure it out.  
    Putting in the effort will get you the results.  </p>
    <h3 class="sprint2-cultural-h3">Experience</h3>
    <p class="sprint2-cultural-para">share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work
      productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.  Discuss the strategies you used at that
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
