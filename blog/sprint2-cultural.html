    <h2 class="blog-h2">My Learning Plan</h2>
    <p class="blog-para">I am constantly appreciating the opportunity I have, to be able to be a student of Dev Academy, so of course I have some 
    goals of what I would like to get out of the program.  The amount of effort and commitment I put in will directly 
    determine the results of what I get out of it, so this learning plan is very important to me.</p>
    <h3 class="blog-h3">Goals:</h3>
    <p class="blog-para">To create a strong portfolio of projects<br>
    Fully understand the concepts that have been taught<br>
    Feel like I got the most that I could out of the course<br>
    Be able to move on to some work experience that will eventually lead to freelancing work</p> 
    <h3 class="blog-h3">My strengths include;</h3>     
    <p class="blog-para">Determination and motivation – I know that this course isn’t going to be easy, so I am willing to be up early and up 
    late until the work is done and I understand what I am learning.<br>
    Work well under pressure – it's actually where I thrive, once there’s a certain amount of pressure I am able to focus 
    for long periods of time in order to complete the task. </p>
    <h3 class="blog-h3">It seems that each strength also has its relative limitation;</h3>
    <p class="blog-para">Time management – this is one I would like to tackle during this course, but currently my schedule is jam-packed, 
    so managing when and how long I can spend on a task is essential to good time management.  <br>
    Perfectionism – I feel like this is a common issue in any creative industry, but I have learnt that completed a 
    task is the goal, not perfecting every single element and running out of time before it is completed. </p>
    <h3 class="blog-h3">Commitments:</h3>
    <p class="blog-para">First of all I have the scheduling task of working around my current job during foundations and bootcamp.  
    I have organised to go to down to 20 hours a week during bootcamp and will continue doing 60 hours a week during 
    the foundations.  This makes managing the workload essential if I want to reach my goals in this course.  
    I also play hockey, so a practice and a game each week.<br>
    During the times that I have scheduled for working on this course, I have to take steps to really focus, 
    in order to stay within the time box for each task, allow time for extra research and clarification, and 
    get the tasks completed in time.  Working in an environment that has no distractions is the biggest help 
    for me, so I’ve set up a desk in my room where I only have my laptop and notebook, and can take a break 
    every 30 mins to check my phone, talk to flat-mates, find snacks etc. </p>         
    <h3 class="blog-h3">Foundations:</h3>
    <p class="blog-para">Since I am at work from 6am-7:30pm, I have scheduled the time that I get home until 11pm to be the time each night 
    that I tackle the tasks.  Weekends are also reserved for the course, with a bit less strictness.  This will work 
    around foundations but the learning plan will change for bootcamp.  I have also discussed with my facilitator the 
    option of taking Wednesday off to focus solely on the sprint for that week, in order to get a head start and encounter 
    any problems earlier in the week rather than the weekend when there’s less help available.  This will be more convenient 
    for myself, and for the people helping me, as they don’t work on the weekends.  This will give me the option of going 
    into the campus to seek help as well.</p>
    <h3 class="blog-h3">Bootcamp:</h3>
    <p class="blog-para">During bootcamp, Dev Academy will be my main priority, and I plan to get to the classroom at 6am each morning to 
    begin learning and stay late until I understand each day’s work and completed as much of the challenges as I can, 
    in order to stay on top of the workload.  In terms of working with other learners, group projects would be very 
    important as I wouldn’t like to let the team down in any way.  This would means committing to any meetings, 
    deadlines or promises, in order to complete the task to a high standard.  If any of this unexpectedly changes 
    or I am struggling, then communicating this to the group as soon as possible is the fair thing to do, so we come 
    up with an alternative solution or tackle the issue together, earlier, before it comes a bigger issue. </p>
    <p class="blog-para">From the facilitation team, I expect that they will do their best to help direct me where I need to go in a 
    timely manner, as long as I have asked for help early in the week.  I think feedback is very important, so 
    knowing what I’m doing wrong before the mistakes turn into bad habits would be appreciated, and guidance and 
    reassurance when needed would also be very helpful. </p>
    <p class="blog-para">All in all, this journey is my responsibility, so I will continue to adapt this plan each week, as I learn 
    what works best for me.</p>
